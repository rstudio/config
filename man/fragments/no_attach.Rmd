## Do not attach the package using `library(config)`

We strongly recommend you use `config::get()` rather than attaching the package using `library(config)`.

In fact, we strongly recommend you never use `library(config)`.

The underlying reason is that the `get()` and `merge()` functions in `{config}` will mask these functions with the same names in base R.
